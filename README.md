Welcome to KeyNote - "Theme-based Investment Tracker"

#About:
With KeyNote you can create ETFs (Exchange-Traded Fund), or as we call them "Themes", based on different sectors and industries. Once you have created an account you can create as many Themes as you'd like and track their performace compared to the S&P 500.

We built this for the educational purpose of building a full stack web app that used a database, made calls to an API, and served multiple templates.
